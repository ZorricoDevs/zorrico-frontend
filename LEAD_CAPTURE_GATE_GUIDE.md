# 🚀 Lead Capture Gate - Targeted Landing Pages Only

## 🎯 **Overview**

The Lead Capture Gate is now configured to appear **ONLY on specific landing pages** (like `/apply-instant`) rather than the entire website. This ensures organic visitors can browse freely while paid traffic is captured as leads.

## 🔧 **How It Works**

### **Organic Traffic (Main Website):**

1. User visits homepage, about, calculators, etc.
2. **No lead capture form** - normal browsing experience
3. **All pages accessible** without restrictions
4. Perfect for SEO and organic user experience

### **Paid Traffic (Landing Pages):**

1. User clicks Facebook/Google ad → `/apply-instant`
2. **Lead Capture Form appears** before content
3. Must fill: Name, Phone, Email, Loan Amount, City
4. After submission: **24-hour access** to all landing pages
5. **Automatic tracking** via Meta Pixel for Facebook ads
